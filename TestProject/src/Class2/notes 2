Data types; char,String, boolean,

we use boolean to store yes or no, true or false

to store whole numbers we have 4 types of boxes:
Byte= small number -128 to 127
Short = for larger number max number 32767
Int = used 90% of time,most used one
Long = at the end put L

 if we want to store decimal numbers in com memory using java we can use next boxes.
        float
        decimal


to write something in java first type MAIN
to print something in java type SOUT
to create boxes INT=
to write short comments on what we are working //
to write longer comments use /* */

if we have to store whole numbers use int
if we have to store decimals always use double
if you have to store character always use String


Java follows rules for naming things like classes and boxes(variables)
1)while naming a class first letter of each work is always UPPERCASE
2)while naming variables or boxes first letter of first word is always lowercase, second word Uppercase
