Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition,
    substractions we can compare things  if two entities are same or not,
     if a number is greater than the other number or not.

     There are three main types of operators.
     1. ARITHMATIC OPERATORS(+,-,/,*,% - modulus(we use it for remainder)
     2. REALTIONAL OPERATORS (we use them to compare two things, we cant use them for springs
     exmpl: if something is bigger than other thing, or if two numbers are same or not,
     if two boolean variables contain same values or not)
     == => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true, if not we get false
     != => if two variables dont contain the same value. we get true if they are not the same
     > => if one value is greater than other value or not, if greater we get a true.
     < => used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on the right
     >= => if the values on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are the same we will get true
     <= => it opposite of >= and used it to check if something is less than or equal to other thing

     Conditional constructs
     ***IfElse
     Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition is true that java execute the code
     otherwise it skips that code.
     How to write ifElse condition:

     if(condition){
any line of code ** you can write another condition inside of this condition***

if() {

}

// equals method is only used for non-primitives
IMPORTANT:
for String we use equals method instead of === sign bc it`s a non-primitive data type


     }
